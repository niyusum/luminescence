# Player Progression Configuration
# LUMEN LAW I.6: All tunable game parameters externalized

# Controls XP curves, level requirements, and milestone rewards

xp_curve:
  # Type of XP curve formula
  # Options: "polynomial", "exponential", "linear"
  type: "polynomial"

  # Base XP required for level 2
  base: 50

  # Exponent for polynomial curve
  # Formula: XP_required = base * (level ^ exponent)
  exponent: 2.0

level_milestones:
  # How often minor milestones occur (every N levels)
  minor_interval: 5

  # How often major milestones occur (every N levels)
  major_interval: 10

  # Rewards for minor milestones (levels 5, 15, 25, etc.)
  minor_rewards:
    # Lumees reward = player_level * lumees_multiplier
    lumees_multiplier: 100

    # Flat auric coin reward
    auric coin: 5

    # Gems reward = player_level / gems_divisor
    gems_divisor: 10

  # Rewards for major milestones (levels 10, 20, 30, etc.)
  major_rewards:
    # Lumees reward = player_level * lumees_multiplier
    lumees_multiplier: 500

    # Flat auric coin reward
    auric coin: 10

    # Flat gems reward
