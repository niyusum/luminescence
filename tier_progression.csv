"Notes:"
"- **Expected Attempts**: 1 / (Success Rate / 100)"
"- **Expected Total Cost**: Fusion Cost × Expected Attempts"
"- **Cumulative Cost**: Sum of all expected costs from T1 to current tier"
"- **Shards Per Failure**: Random range (3-15 with avg ~9)"
"- **Base Power**: Assumed linear scaling (20 per tier) for ATK+DEF total"
"- **F2P Weeks Estimate**: Time to reach first maiden of each tier via fusion path, assuming:"
"  - 2 hours active playtime per day"
"  - 3 fusion attempts per day (when resources allow)"
"  - 100 energy/day for exploration (~2.5k lumees)"
"  - 50 stamina/day for ascension (~40k lumees)"
"  - 3 Lesser Shrines at Level 6 by mid-game (~232k lumees/day)"
"  - Daily/weekly rewards (~10-15k lumees/day)"
""
"**Total Lumees to T12 via Fusion Path: ~17.27 Million**"
""
"**Alternative Paths:**"
"- **Exploration Capture (T12)**: Sector 7 encounters, 2% capture rate → ~25,000 energy investment OR 25k lumenite guaranteed purification"
"- **Direct Summon (L50)**: Unlock T12 summons at level 50, subject to gacha rates (~4.5% if all tiers unlocked)"
""
"**Tier 12 Power Projection:**"
"- Full T12 Team (6 maidens): 240 × 6 = 1,440 strategic power"
"- Realistic Mixed Team (L50): 1x T12 + 2x T10 + 3x T8 = 1,120 power"
"- Stat Allocation Impact (Level 50, 250 points): +800 energy OR +400 stamina OR +25,000 HP"
""
"**Diminishing Returns:**"
"- T1-T5: High success rates (75-55%), fast progression, low cost"
"- T6-T9: Moderate success (50-35%), shard accumulation phase, exponential cost"
"- T10-T11: Low success (30-25%), heavy shard dependency, massive lumees sink"
"- T12: Terminal tier, cannot fuse further, requires alternative progression (awakenin system not yet implemented)"
""
"**Shard Redemption Analysis:**"
"- 100 shards required for guaranteed fusion"
"- Average 9 shards per failure → ~11 failures to reach 100 shards"
"- T11 Example: 11 failures × 2.66M lumees = 29.2M lumees (vs 10.6M expected via RNG)"
"- **Verdict**: Shards are LESS efficient than repeated RNG attempts for all tiers"
""
"**Time-to-Endgame:**"
"- First T12 Maiden: 30-35 weeks (7-8 months) F2P"
"- Full T12 Team (6 maidens): 50-70 weeks (12-18 months) F2P"
"- Level 100: 80+ weeks (18+ months) active play"
""
"**Grind Intensity Comparison:**"
"- F2P (1 hr/day): 35-40 weeks to first T12"
"- Active (2 hr/day): 30-35 weeks to first T12"
"- Heavy (4+ hr/day + shrine optimization): 20-25 weeks to first T12"
"- Whale (lumenite for guaranteed purifications): 1-2 weeks to first T12 (requires 25k lumenite)"
